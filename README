This is my own (fairly outdated) copy of TempleOS by Terry Davis. See the main site at <http://templeos.org> for proper documentation of the OS.

I have some prototypes lying around I wanted to implement in TempleOS, but haven't found the time yet to hack at it, so nothing interesting is happening here (yet).

I'm unsure if this copy constitutes heresy, and generally advise against using it. (Any information about God's stance on the issue would be appreciated.)

> For it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will give praise to God." Therefore, each of us will give an account of himself to God. -- Romans 14:11-12

Changes I've made:

1. Added code to git repo so I can keep track of and easily distribute my additions. Everything remains public domain, of course.

2. Because TempleOS doesn't have networking and fiddling with disk images is annoying, the best way to transfer data is to modify the boot image directly. This is why, instead of some isolated code, you get this whole distribution instead. There is a new directory, `ExtraEcclesiam`, which contains all non-TempleOS code, including a shell build script for the .iso.
