The $FG,2$$TX+HTML,"trivial solution","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_solution"$$FG$ in math is the simple, obvious answer.  The fable that NASA spent millions on a space pen while Russia used a pencil is an example.  TempleOS uses many $LK,"trivial solutions","FI:::/TempleOS/Doc/Strategy.TXT"$.

$FG,2$About Me:$FG$
I was a National Merit Scholar with a 1440 SAT at Arizona State University.  Here are my $TX+HTML,"ASU Transcripts","http://www.templeos.org/files/ASU_Transcripts.pdf"$.  I have a bachelor's in Computer System Engineering from ASU, basically, embedded systems, and a master's in Electrical Engineering from ASU, control systems.  I worked as a software, hardware and mechanical engineer at Ticketmaster from 1990-1996.  I designed a 3 axis stepper-motor-driven milling machine 1996-1997 with a CAD/CAM package for a company I started called Home Automation and Robotic Equipment.  I worked for a company named Xytec Corp. 1997-1999.  We made FPGA-based image processing equipment.  I wrote $FG,2$$TX+HTML,"SimStructure","http://www.templeos.org/files/SimStrSetUp.zip"$$FG$ from 2000-2001 for H.A.R.E.  I worked as head software/electrical engineer for a company called Graphic Technologies, 2001-2002, making replacement chips for toner printer cartridges so they could be refilled.
