$WW,1$Intel/AMD have an instruction that returns the num of CPU cycles since boot.  This is not calibrated to an accurate real time value and, the CPUspeed is throttled!  TempleOS measures it and you can convert with $LK,"time_stamp_freq","MN:time_stamp_freq"$, a value continuously calibrated from other timers.  This is the fastest timer available.
