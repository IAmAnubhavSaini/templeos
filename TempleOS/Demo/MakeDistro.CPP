It's unlikely you will get it running on bare hardware, so you'll probably
run it in a virtual machine such as VMware.  Download the free 64-bit
$FG,4$$TX+HTML,"VMware Player","https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0"$$FG$ for Linux or Windows and point the CDROM at the $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"TempleOSCD.ISO","http://www.templeos.org/TempleOSCD.ISO"$$FG$.
(The $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"VMware","https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0"$$FG$ web page takes a whole minute to load.  They hide the free version.)

Purchase $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"VMware WorkStation","http://www.vmware.com"$$FG$ or download $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"WinImage","http://www.winimage.com/winimage.htm"$$FG$ if you wish to transfer files
in and out.  The VMWare Workstation will stretch to full-screen and make drives
accessible from Windows.
